# ct-recomp

[![ci](https://github.com/ThisIsAkill/ct-recomp/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ThisIsAkill/ct-recomp/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Static recompiler for Chrono Trigger (SNES, US 1.0) 65816 code to C, plus a C runtime.
The recompiler and runtime are game-agnostic; everything specific to Chrono
Trigger lives in `game/ct/`.

## Layout

- `recomp/` — the translator (Python): decoder with static M/X tracking, C emitter.
- `runtime/` — CPU, bus, cycle model, interpreter, frame scheduler; the vendored
  PPU/DMA/APU core lives in `third_party/snes/`.
- `frontend/` — SDL2 frontend; `tools/ct_boot.c` — headless boot probe.
- `test/` — engine tests; they run on a synthetic ROM generated at build time.
- `game/ct/` — everything specific to Chrono Trigger: `game.toml` (ROM identity),
  `funcs.toml` / `unresolved.toml` (symbols), extern hooks, game tools, the
  ROM-dependent tests, and `PROGRESS.md`.

## Build

Requirements: CMake 3.20+, a C11 compiler, Python 3.11+, SDL2 (optional, for
`ct_sdl`).

Engine only (no ROM needed; what CI runs):

```
cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j && ctest --test-dir build -LE rom
```

With the game. Supply your own headerless US 1.0 ROM; it is checked against
`game/ct/game.toml` at configure time:

```
export CT_ROM=/path/to/chrono_trigger.sfc   # headerless, 4 MB
cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j && ctest --test-dir build
```

This builds `game/ct` (generated C goes to `build/game/ct/out/`) and two
programs at the top of `build/`:

```
build/ct_sdl                           # play: window, audio, keyboard/controller
mkdir -p shots && build/ct_boot --frames 1500 --dump shots   # headless: PNGs of what changed
```

`ct_sdl` keys: arrows, Z=B, X=A, A=Y, S=X, Q=L, W=R, Enter=Start, Right Shift=Select;
a game controller works too. Ctrl+Q or closing the window quits. `ct_boot` also
takes `--input F1-F2:BUTTONS` to script the pad, `--wav FILE` for audio, and
`--needed-hw FILE` to report where emulation stops.

The ROM is never committed, and CI never sees it.
